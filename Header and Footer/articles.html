                <h1>Oculus Rift</h1>
                The Oculus Rift is a new virtual reality headset that lets players step inside their favorite games and virtual worlds.
                The Rift uses custom tracking technology to provide ultra-low latency 360° head tracking, allowing you to seamlessly look around the virtual world just as you would in real life.he Oculus Rift creates a stereoscopic 3D view with excellent depth, scale, and parallax. Unlike 3D on a television or in a movie, this is achieved by presenting unique and parallel images for each eye. The Oculus Rift provides an approximately 100° field of view, stretching the virtual world beyond your peripheral vision. Your view of the game is no longer boxed in on a screen and is only limited by what your eyes can see. The combination of the wide field of view with head-tracking and stereoscopic 3D creates an immersive virtual reality experience.

                <h1>Iron Man</h1>
                Coming soon to a top-secret government lab near you…Iron Man?
                Sort of. Last week, in a case of life imitating art -- or least the demands of the domestic box office -- President Obama made mention of an Army project called TALOS during remarks at a White House event announcing the development of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. Obama jokingly said of the undertaking, "Basically I'm here to announce that we're building Iron Man…This has been a secret project we've been working on for a long time. Not really. Maybe. It’s classified."
                So... Iron Man eh ? I smell awesomeness. Of course it won't be free and it won't be easy to lay your hands on but it's still pretty badass. Black Sabbath anyone ?

                <h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
                We all know the cool dino-lonely-island-mega-giga-cool movie. But what if we we're able to really bring back the dinosaurs? Well first of all it will be EPIC and second it won't be that kind of a disaster.
                I mean they can be held in cages. In the movie it was all the producers fault. Who the hell builds dinotopia on a isolated island with no way to turn around the incoming events.
                Anyway, as cool as it would be to have our ancestors back it isn't possible. Even if we can bring them back they won't be the way they were.
